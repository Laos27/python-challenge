# python-challenge
The codes for this task are located in the repo Laos27/python-challenge within the Folders PyPoll and PyBank. Both files are called main.py.
Tje results were exported to Text Files, which are located within a Folder called analysis that exists inside the main Folders (PyPoll and PyBank).

To finish PyBank Assignment I was having issues calculating the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period - to solve this issue I joined the Tutoring session 
held on 05/04/23, which helped me significantly to understand how the loop and the append function work. We could solve the issue during this session.

To complete the Task 2 PyPoll - I used mainly Google to look for functions. For instance, I googled how to do a loop to export the results.
Task 2 was easier to complete, after all the time spent in Task 1 + the tutoring explanation on 05/04/23.
